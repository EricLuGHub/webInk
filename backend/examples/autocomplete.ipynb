To algebraically describe the notion of cycles, we first define chains and boundary maps. \\\\begin{definition}[Chains] Define $C_0(G)$ as the $Z_2$-vector space with basis $V$, and $C_1(G)$ as the $Z_2$-vector space with basis $E$. Thus, an element of $C_0(G)$ takes the form \\\\[c = a_1v_1 + ... + a_nv_n\\\\] and is called a 0-chain. Similarly, an element of $C_1(G)$ takes the form \\\\[c = a_1e_1 + ... + a_me_m\\\\] and is called a 1-chain.\\\\end{definition}\\\\begin{definition}[Boundary Maps] For $k=0, 1, 2, ...$, the boundary map $\\\\delta_k$ is defined as a linear map \\\\[\\\\delta_k: C_k \\\\rightarrow C_{k-1}\\\\] In the special context of graphs, we have $\\\\delta_0=0$ and $\\\\delta_1(e) = u + v$, where $e$ connects vertices $u$ and $v$. Notice that $\\\\delta_{k-1} \\\\circ \\\\delta_k = 0$.

First, $H_1 = Z_1/B_1 = Z_1$ because $\\\\delta_2 = 0$. Indeed, for $c\\\\in C_1$, $\\\\delta_1(c) = 0$ if $c$ is a cycle and so each vertex appears twice (recall that $C_i$ are $Z_2$-vector spaces). Hence $H_1$ captures the idea of cycles. Second, $H_0 = Z_0/B_0 = C_0/B_0$ because $\\\\delta_0 = 0$. Therefore, for vertices $u, v$, $u = v$ in $H_0$ if and only if there exists $c = e_{l_1} + ... + e_{l_k}\\\\in C_1$ such thateditEditingkeyboard_arrow_downchevron_rightarrow_right_altarrow_left_altRecompileexpand_moredescription1download65%more_horiz2 INTRODUCTION1 AbstractTopological data analysis aims to extract information about the shape of data.In order to understand this technique, we first present an intuitive introductionto topology and some basic theorems. The idea of homology is then examinedin two recurrent contexts: graphs and cubical sets. We then present algorithmsto compute the homology groups. This involves concepts from group theory andlinear algebra.2 Introduction2.1 Characterizing the Shape of DataCollecting and analyzing data is crucial to decision-making. However, it isgenerally difficult to extract the relevant information from high-dimensionaldatasets. First, high dimensionality makes data visualization challenging (thinkof 4D and higher dimensional data). Second, tasks such as machine learningare generally intensive from a computation standpoint; computation costs canbecome prohibitive when the inputs are high-dimensional.Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a framework to extract the shapeof high-dimensional, noisy datasets. Using TDA, one can characterize a high-dimensional dataset by its topological features: the number of connected com-ponents, the number of loops, the number of voids, etc.2.2 Persistent HomologyThe main tool in TDA is persistent homology. The method consists in varyinga parameter ϵ > 0 and connecting data points with a distance less than ϵbetween each other. That is, each ϵ > 0 gives a topological space for whichwe compute the homology groups. The reason for such a procedure is to studythe persistence of topological features as ϵ varies. By looking at persistence,one can supposedly distinguish true features from noise. Therefore, persistencehomology is generally robust to noise.The workflow is as follows: first, a point cloud X is replaced with a complex(simplicial or cubical). Then, we take the homology of the complex. By varyingthe parameter ϵ, we obtain a sequence of homology groups. This allows us toconstruct a persistence bar code. Finally, some metrics are defined on the spaceof persistence bar codes: the two most common ones are the bottleneck and theWasserstein distances. This allows us to quantify how different two datasets arefrom each other.April 1 2024, Yizhou Wang, Topological Data Analysis, 34 COMPUTATIONAL HOMOLOGY3 Introduction to Topology3.1 Brief, Intuitive IntroductionTopology is the branch of mathematics that studies the shapes of objects. Incontrast to geometry which is concerned with precise distances and shapes,topologists are interested in the properties of spaces that are invariant under anycontinuous deformation. Intuitively, continuous deformations can be thought ofas actions that stretch and contract, but never cut or break the object. Forexample, a coffee mug can be stretched and contracted into the shape of atorus. Therefore, a coffee mug is topologically equivalent to a torus.More formally, a topological space is a set with a notion of ”open subsets”.Definition 3.1 (Topological Space). A topology on a set X is a collection T ofsubsets of X having the following properties:1. X and the empty set are in T .2. The union of the elements of any subcollection of T is in T .3. The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of T is in T .The elements of T are called the open subsets of X.The idea of continuous deformation can also be defined mathematically.Definition 3.2 (Homeomorphism). Let X, Y be topological spaces. Let f :X → Y be a bijection. If both f and f −1 are continuous, then f is called ahomeomorphism.An alternative wording is that for all U ⊂ X, f (U ) is open if and only if Uis open.3.2 Algebraic Topology and HomologyAlgebraic topology uses the tools of abstract algebra to study topological spaces.Homology, an important branch of algebraic topology, associates to a topologicalspace X a sequence of abelian groups Hi(X). Furthermore, these groups havea concrete meaning: Hi(X) represents the group of commutable i-dimensionalcycles of X.It can be shown that if two topological spaces X, Y are homeomorphic orhomotopy equivalent, then Hi(X) = Hi(Y ).4 Computational HomologyAs previously mentioned, given a (potentially high-dimensional) dataset, wewish to compute its topological features: the number of loops, voids, and theirhigher-dimensional counterparts.

For the restof this subsection, let G be a graph with a set of vertices V and a set of edgesE. Since G is composed of vertices and edges, the highest non-trivial homologygroup is H1(G). To algebraically describe the notion of cycles, we first definechains and boundary maps.Definition 4.1 (Chains). Define C0(G) as the Z2-vector space with basis V ,and C1(G) as the Z2-vector space with basis E. Thus, an element of C0(G)takes the formc = a1v1 + ... + anvnand is called a 0-chain. Similarly, an element of C1(G) takes the formc = a1e1 + ... + amemand is called a 1-chain.Definition 4.2 (Boundary Maps). For k = 0, 1, 2, ..., the boundary map δk isdefined as a linear mapδk : Ck → Ck−1In the special context of graphs, we have δ0 = 0 and δ1(e) = u + v, where econnects vertices u and v. Notice that δk−1 ◦ δk = 0. This will always be arequired property of the boundary map.Now the homology groups are defined as follows:Definition 4.3 (Homology Groups). DefineHi = Zi/Biwhere Zi = ker δi and Bi = im δi+1.We verify that in the context of graphs, this definition captures the idea ofconnected components and cycles. First, H1 = Z1/B1 = Z1 because δ2 = 0.Indeed, for c ∈ C1, δ1(c) = 0 if c is a cycle and so each vertex appears twice(recall that Ci are Z2-vector spaces). Hence H1 captures the idea of cycles.Second, H0 = Z0/B0 = C0/B0 because δ0 = 0. Therefore, for vertices u, v,u = v in H0 if and only if there exists c = el1 + ... + elk ∈ C1 such thatu = v + δ1(c)This means that el1 , ..., elk is a path from vertex u to v. Hence H0 captures theidea of connected components.April 1 2024, Yizhou Wang, Topological Data Analysis, 5LaTeX Error: Unknown option `⟨options⟩\\' for package `fancyhdr\\'.link\\u202a/usr/local/texlive/2023/texmf-dist/tex/latex/fancyhdr/fancyhdr.sty, 131\\u202cSuggest fixSee the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
